# Set
Picture matching card game

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1198/set

### Planned features:
* main menu
  * score board
  * rules
  * options
* local multiplayer (basically some way to give credit for sets to separate players, but they'd have to share a mouse.)
* hints (finding sets and highlighting one card of one possible set)
